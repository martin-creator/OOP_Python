# Object-Oriented Programming in Python Live Training 2023

This is the code for the *Safari Live Training* - **Object-Oriented Programming in Python** presented by Arianne Dee

**Note**: If you're looking for the project code for a specific date in the past,
look for the specific class [here](https://github.com/ariannedee/oop-python/releases)

Before the class, please follow these instructions:
1. [Install Python](#1-install-python-36-or-higher)
1. [Check that Python was installed properly](#2-make-sure-that-python-is-properly-installed)
1. [Install PyCharm](#3-download-pycharm-community-edition)
1. [Download the code](#4-download-the-course-files)
5. [Download the resources](#5-at-the-beginning-of-class-download-the-resources)

## Set up instructions
### 1. Install Python 3.6 or higher
Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/

Click the yellow button at the top to download the latest version of Python.

#### On Mac or Linux
Follow the prompts and install using the default settings.

#### On Windows
The default settings don't add Python to your PATH 
so your computer doesn't know where to look for it when Python runs 
(for some inexplicable reason).

##### If you're just installing Python now
Follow the instructions here: [Windows Python installer instructions](docs/WININSTALL.md)

##### If you've already installed Python with the default settings
Follow the instructions here: [Add Python to PATH variable in Windows](docs/WINSETPATH.md)

### 2. Make sure that Python is properly installed
1. Open the *Command Prompt* application in Windows
or *Terminal* on Mac or Linux

1. Type `python --version` and press enter

1. Type `python3 --version` and press enter

1. One or both of those commands should print 
a Python version of 3.6 or higher 
(whichever version you just downloaded).
 If it doesn't, you have to follow instructions to
 [add Python to your PATH variable](docs/WINSETPATH.md).

**Note:** 
You can now type just the `python` or `python3` command
in *Command Prompt* or *Terminal* 
to run the Python interpreter.
You can also run a *.py* file by running 
`python filename.py`

### 3. Download PyCharm (Community Edition)
Download here: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/

Install, open, and use the default settings.

### 4. Download the course files
If you're viewing this on GitHub already, stay on this page.
Otherwise, go to the GitHub repository: https://github.com/ariannedee/oop-python

#### If you know git:
Clone the repository.

#### If you don't know git:
1. Click the "Clone or download" (green) button at the top-right of the page
2. Click "Download ZIP"
3. Unzip it and move the **oop-python-master** folder to a convenient location

### 5. At the beginning of class, download the resources
When you have signed in to the class,
the **Resources** widget will have PDFs for the slides and
for a resource package that has PyCharm shortcuts, links, and a Python 2 to 3 comparison

## FAQs
### Can I use Python 2?

Yes. There are not many differences for this class.

### Can I use a different code editor besides PyCharm?

Jupyter notebooks are not ideal since we'll be working from multiple folders throughout the class.

Other IDEs like VS Code, Atom, and Spyder will work, but they are only recommended if you are already know it 
and are comfortable navigating to different files and running commands in the command line. 
If it has syntax highlighting for Python, that is ideal.

### PyCharm can't find Python 3

On a Mac:
- Go to **PyCharm** > **Preferences**

On a PC:
- Go to **File** > **Settings**

Once in Settings:
1. Go to **Project: oop-python** > **Project Interpreter**
1. Look for your Python version in the Project Interpreter dropdown
1. If it's not there, click **gear icon** > **Add...**
1. In the new window, select **System Interpreter** on the left, and then look for the Python version in the dropdown
1. If it's not there, click the **...** button and navigate to your Python location
   - To find where Python is located, [look in these directories](docs/PATH_LOCATIONS.md)
   - You may have to search the internet for where Python gets installed by default on your operating system

### Do you offer private Python help?
Yes, email **arianne.dee.studios at gmail.com** if you have any questions
or would like to set up some remote training.
